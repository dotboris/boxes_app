Boxes is a collaborative drawing app. Here's how it works: 

A picture gets ingested into a server system and cut up into pieces. App users can grab these image pieces and redraw
them on their Android device. These pieces and sent back to the server where they are glued together with other pieces
redrawn by other users. These collages of redrawn pieces are made available for all users to see.

- ~~Drawing interface~~
- Fetching & sending pieces from/to the server
