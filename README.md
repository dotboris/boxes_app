Boxes App
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beraboris/boxes_app.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/beraboris/boxes_app)

This is the client portion of a collaborative drawing app called Boxes. This is an Android application.

Boxes is a school project and is meant to be more of a proof of concept than anything else. This is, of course, not
meant for production.

For this app to work, you'll need to have the [server](https://github.com/beraboris/boxes_server) up and running.
